# VSCode GBA Template
i really like VS Code so i made a template for it<br/>
this template is primarily made with Linux in mind, you will likely need to update the config in `.vscode` to make it work on your machine :P

# Tasks
`Launch Usenti`: Executes `/usr/bin/usenti`<br/>
`Launch OpenMPT`: Executes `/usr/bin/openmpt`<br/>
`Run in No$GBA`: Runs the `.gba` file in No$GBA via `/usr/bin/nocashgba-debugger`<br/>
`Run in mGBA`: Runs the `.gba` file in mGBA via `/usr/bin/mgba-qt`<br/>

# Debugging
The GDB server works as it should, thank god.
